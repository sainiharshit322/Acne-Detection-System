This project aims to develop a **deep learning model** capable of analyzing facial images to detect common skin conditions such as **Blackheads**, **Cyst**, **Papules**, **Pustules**, and **Whiteheads**. The system not only identifies these conditions but also provides personalized recommendations for each detected issue, making it a helpful tool for users seeking insights into their skin health.

## Overview

The **Acne Analysis Model** leverages **EfficientNetB0**, a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture, to classify facial images into five categories of acne conditions. The model is trained on a custom dataset and incorporates advanced techniques like **data augmentation**, **class weights**, and **dropout regularization** to ensure robust performance. Additionally, the project includes a **confusion matrix** and **F1-score analysis** to evaluate model performance.

## Features

- **Multi-Class Classification**: Detects five types of acne conditions: Blackheads, Cyst, Papules, Pustules, and Whiteheads.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides tailored skincare advice based on detected conditions.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances the dataset with techniques like flipping, rotation, brightness adjustment, and Gaussian noise.
- **Class Weights**: Addresses class imbalance during training.
- **Confusion Matrix & Metrics**: Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Custom Image Prediction**: Allows users to upload their own images for real-time predictions.
